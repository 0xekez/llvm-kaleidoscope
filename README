============
Kaleidoscope
============

This pretty closely follows LLVM's kaleidoscope tutorial. Other than
some tiny changes to variable names and namespaces its actually pretty
much the same. There are also some additional comments that I've
written as a reference to myself later. You can find the tutorial in
question at the link below. I'm quite liking it so far.

If you'd like to run this code or use it yourself, either go on the
turorial link and scroll down to where it says how to compile this, or
run the equivalent of the following command on your machine:

/opt/clang9/bin/clang++ -g -rdynamic kaleidoscope.cpp `/opt/clang9/bin/llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs all` -O3 -o kaleidoscope
